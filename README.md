# JSValidator - JavaScript Code Validator
The JSValidator is a service that uses the JSHint API to check your JavaScript code for errors and potential problems. The service is a code quality tool that useful for everyone who wants to validate their JavaScript code regularly. It also can be used to check the code of [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) students' projects before they submit them for review.


## Deployment

### How to use an JSHint API?
The JSValidator uses the JSHint API which allows developer to run [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) on your code without having to install anything.

JSHint API is free but it does require an API key, so  youâ€™ll need to complete the sign-up process.

**The key is only available to current students of Code Institute, and the API will check that before giving you the key. All API keys are valid for a period of 1 year.**
