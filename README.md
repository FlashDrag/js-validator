# The Simple implementation of the JSValidator
It's a simple example of the service with an exposed API key and without using the Netlify Serverless Functions and jQuery.

It's not recommended to use this implementation in production, as your API key will be exposed to the public.

_This implementation can be easily run locally or deployed on the GitHub Pages as it doesn't require the server-side code or back-end dependencies such as Node.js and Axios_
